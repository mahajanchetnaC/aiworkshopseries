# AI Workshop Series — Session 2

## 🤔 Tired of AI feeling like a mystery box?
Let’s crack it open together 🚀

I’m excited to announce the second session of my AI Workshop Series — a set of hands-on, interactive sessions where we’ll break down AI concepts and apply them to real-world use cases.

The first session for Antigravity had great response. Thank you for the support.
